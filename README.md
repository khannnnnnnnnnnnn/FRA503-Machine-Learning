# Machine Learning Course Projects

A collection of three comprehensive machine learning projects analyzing the SUPPORT2 and Bank Marketing datasets, covering regression and classification techniques with systematic experimental approaches.

## Projects Overview

### Homework 1: Linear Regression Analysis
**File:** `HW01_6611_6676.ipynb`

Predicting **hospital charges** using linear regression on the SUPPORT2 dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Two model implementations (with/without outlier treatment)
- Statistical feature selection (Pearson correlation, Mutual Information, ANOVA)
- Log transformation for skewed distributions
- Comprehensive residual analysis
- Evaluation: R², MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE

**Dataset:** 9,105 patients | 47 features | Target: charges (continuous)

### Homework 2: Logistic Regression Classification
**File:** `HW02_6611_6676.ipynb`

Predicting **in-hospital mortality** using logistic regression on the SUPPORT2 dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Binary classification (hospdead: yes/no)
- Two model configurations with different preprocessing approaches
- Chi-square and Mutual Information for feature selection
- ROC-AUC analysis with multiple threshold evaluation
- Comprehensive confusion matrix and precision-recall analysis

**Dataset:** 9,105 patients | 47 features | Target: hospdead (binary)

### Final Project: Multi-Model Classification Comparison
**File:** `Project_ML_6611_6635_6676.ipynb`

Predicting **term deposit subscription** with systematic comparison of four classifiers on the Bank Marketing dataset.

**Key Features:**
- **4×4 Factorial Design:** 4 models × 4 preprocessing pipelines = 16 configurations
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Pipelines:** Outlier Treatment (OT) × Feature Transformation (T) combinations
- 5-fold cross-validation with ROC-AUC as primary metric
- Feature engineering (pdays splitting into contact_flag + pdays_actual)

**Dataset:** 45,211 samples | 17 features | Target: y (binary - term deposit subscription)
